# Social Network with NoSQL database

Universidad Politécnica de Extremadura (UNEX)

## Practice

This project is about to design a sistem that needs a NoSQL database to be used to it. The application is the social part of a social network, letting the user manage friends, send petitions of friendship and block people to ignore them.

The second part of this project is about the explotation of the collected data, but it is not covered here becouse it was a python script that uses a Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to improve the elements to suggest to the user to be friends. 

A brief explanation can be found in the root of the project. For the slides of a presentation is [the presentation](./Presentation.pdf) and for a more redacted documented is [the documentation](./Documentación.pdf).
