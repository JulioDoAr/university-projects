# Online Supermarket 2

Universidad Politécnica de Extremadura (UNEX)
2023-2024

## Practice

This is the second version of the Online Supermarket. 

Instead of create a traditional app, it is choosen to create the same supermarket but separate front and back.

To build the back-end it is used [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). We use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to create a REST api to be consumed by the client.

To build the front-end it is used [React](https://es.react.dev/). We created a diagram to help us to atomice the UI and modelate on different components.

The session is faked due to it was not a must on the project and we didnt have a lot of time.
